I'm a software engineer who's just starting his journey. I want to focus on perception algorithms and make a cut into the ML/AI industry.
I am driven by the pure instinct of improving myself. Maybe I started later than most but I will get there at my own pace.

* Just graduated from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca and joined a MsC program which involves AI and ML,
* Implemented Visual-Inertial Odometry for my [[bachelor's thesis|https://costinchitic.co/projects/Bachelors]],
* Looking to join the robotics team at my University led by professor Lucian Busoniu.

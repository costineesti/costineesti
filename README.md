I'm a software engineer who's just starting. I want to focus on perception algorithms and make a cut into the ML/AI industry.
I am driven by the pure instinct of improving myself.

* Just graduated from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca and joined a MsC program which involves AI and ML,
* Implemented Visual-Inertial Odometry for my [bachelor's thesis](https://costinchitic.co/projects/Bachelors).

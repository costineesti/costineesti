## Hello there 👋

I'm a software engineer recently graduated from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. I enjoy applications that involve **perception algorithms, ML/AI and Robotics**.

* Mainly contributing to [SeaClear](https://costinchitic.wiki/seaclear) where currently I am working on streamlining processes such as autonomous synchronization of two cameras for real-time ground truth validation of 3D pose estimation. Due to my constant input, I have been awarded with a scholarship.
* Currently studying at two Master's: one in Cluj-Napoca where my focus in on AI/ML applications and one at The University of Twente in Enschede/Netherlands where I study Robotics and AI.

## In the past
* Implemented Visual-Inertial Odometry for my [bachelor's thesis](https://costinchitic.wiki/projects/Bachelors).
* Worked at Bosch for 3 full years streamlining workflows and fully automating open-loop and closed-loop testing environments and creating large-scale projects from scratch using mainly Python (OOP, APIs) and MATLAB.
